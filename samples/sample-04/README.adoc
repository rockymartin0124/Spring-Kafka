== Sample 4

This sample demonstrates non-blocking retry (`@RetryableTopic`) with a simple producer and consumer; the producer sends Strings posted to the rest controller.

Strings starting with `fail` are rejected and retried.

Run the application and use curl to send some data:

`$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/fail; curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send/good`


Console:

`2021-05-11 16:17:55.372  INFO 75520 --- [ fooGroup-0-C-1] com.example.Application : Received: fail from topic4 @ xx`

`2021-05-11 16:17:55.399  INFO 75520 --- [ fooGroup-0-C-1] com.example.Application : Received: good from topic4 @ xx`

`2021-05-11 16:17:57.384  INFO 75520 --- [etry-2000-0-C-1] com.example.Application : Received: fail from topic4-retry-2000 @ xx`

`2021-05-11 16:18:09.399  INFO 75520 --- [etry-8000-0-C-1] com.example.Application : Received: fail from topic4-retry-8000 @ xx`

As you can see the "good" record is processed while the failed record is retried by the series of retry topics.
